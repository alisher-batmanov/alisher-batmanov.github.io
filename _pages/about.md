I am a fourth-year Economics Ph.D. candidate at [University of California San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu). Prior to UC San Diego, I earned an M.A. in Economics at Central European University.

My primary fields are experimental economics and behavioral economics. In particular, I use laboratory experiments to study how people learn by observing othersâ€™ choices. I also work on topics related to student mental health by running studies in the field. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Emanuel Vespa](https://sites.google.com/site/emanuelvespa/) and [Isabel Trevino](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~itrevino/).
