I am a fourth-year Economics Ph.D. candidate at [University of California San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu). Prior to UC San Diego, I earned an M.A. in Economics at Central European University.

My primary fields are experimental economics and behavioral economics. I am particularly interested in experimentally studying how people learn from each other's decisions. I also work on topics related to studentsâ€™ beliefs about mental health.
