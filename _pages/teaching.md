*"The professor did a wonderful job engaging the students in a way that made the information stick. I appreciate his teaching style and the things I learned"; "The rate the material was taught at was easy to follow in context of the quick pace for summer session"; "Made sure he was readily available, especially in the discord channel that was made for the
class"; "I especially liked how interactive lectures were"; "He was really welcoming and interested in the lives of his students. He asked me about my work and why I was taking the class. He also went above and beyond by answering questions on discord that my team and I had. He was always prompt and informative"*
