## Course Instructor

- <span style="color:#001f3d"><strong>ECON 120B: Econometrics B (Linear Regression and Causal Inference) - Summer 2024 ([Evaluations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTTdraeTxzaEmDzAUwtd2Wk6ZQ-fMIl0/view?usp=share_link))</strong></span>  
  (Student learning - 4.24/5, Course structure - 4.36/5, Class environment - 4.64/5)
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "The professor did a wonderful job engaging the students in a way that made the information stick. I appreciate his teaching style and the things I learned; He was really welcoming and interested in the lives of his students. He asked me about my work and why I was taking the class. He also went above and beyond by answering questions on discord that my team and I had. He was always prompt and informative."
  </span>
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "The rate the material was taught at was easy to follow in context of the quick pace for summer session; Made sure he was readily available, especially in the discord channel that was made for the class; I especially liked how interactive lectures were."
  </span>
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "The structure of class and the PowerPoints were relatively easy to follow along, the instructor did a good job on teaching the material and following it up with practice problems. I also really loved and appreciated the bonus pop quizzes. I commuted from LA for class this summer so at times it was hard to get myself to go to class. However, the bonus quizzes encouraged me to go to class with a positive mindset because I knew I was only helping my grade. Getting to do a bonus quiz helped me get to class and learn in person!"

## Teaching Assistant

- <span style="color:#001f3d"><strong>ECON 220B: Econometric Analysis of Cross-sectional Data (PhD core) - Winter 2023 ([Evaluations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W9ghTAdWt5m5OivkdIutZMZZaIOOASX5/view?usp=share_link))</strong></span>

  <span style="display:block;">
  "Alisher was by far the best TA we had this quarter, and he is the best TA we have had for metrics. This is a sentiment I know many of my peers share, as it has been a common topic of conversation throughout the quarter. I could not have asked for a better metrics TA and I wish Alisher was TAing for 220C as well, and I hope that he will lead our qual review sessions. Alisher was extremely prepared for discussion, especially considering this was his first time TAing this class."
  </span>
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "Phenomenal TA. He went above and beyond writing out notes for discussions, soliciting feedback to improve throughout, giving detailed explanations when grading, and holding additional review sessions for each exam. He deserves all the awards. Please make him the metrics Qual TA."
  </span>
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "Alisher is my role model TA. It is an understatement to say that he goes out of his way for his students."

  <span style="display:block;">
  "He is one of the most well prepared TAs I’ve had for any of my lectures and the material covered in discussion sections are really helpful. The discussion sections were incredibly helpful and honestly helped me become more interested in the material - Alisher’s thought process/approaches to the problems were really interesting and insightful throughout the quarter"
  </span>
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "I usually don’t submit evaluations for TAs because I hardly interact with them, but I genuinely understood the material thoroughly because of Alisher’s help. His discussions were extremely informative and he made time for those who couldn’t make it to his original office hours. Would absolutely recommend him to other students."
  </span>
  
  <span style="display:block;">
  "TA Alisher Batmanov demonstrates genuine care for students, quickly responding to any messages on the class discord. He makes discussion sections engaging, both by explaining material and homework, but also by making tangible games and activities for students during discussion. He goes the extra mile to provide clear grading guidelines rather than relying solely on Gradescope's feedback."
