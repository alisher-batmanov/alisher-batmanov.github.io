    *"TA Alisher Batmanov demonstrates genuine care for students, quickly responding to any messages on the class discord. He makes discussion sections engaging, both by explaining material and homework, but also by making tangible games and activities for students during discussion.

    *"I usually don't submit evaluations for TAs because I hardly interact with them, but I genuinely understood the material thoroughly because of Alisher's help. His discussions were extremely informative and he made time for those who couldn't make it to his original office hours. Would absolutely recommend him to other students"*
