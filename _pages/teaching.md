    <p>"The professor did a wonderful job engaging the students in a way that made the information stick. I appreciate his teaching style and the things I learned; He was really welcoming and interested in the lives of his students. He asked me about my work and why I was taking the class. He also went above and beyond by answering questions on discord that my team and I had. He was always prompt and informative."</p>
    <p>"The rate the material was taught at was easy to follow in context of the quick pace for summer session; Made sure he was readily available, especially in the discord channel that was made for the class; I especially liked how interactive lectures were."</p>

    "Alisher is my role model TA. It is an understatement to say that he goes out of his way for his students; Alisher was by far the best TA we had this quarter, and he is the best TA we have had for metrics. This is a sentiment I know many of my peers share, as it has been a common topic of conversation throughout the quarter. I could not have asked for a better metrics TA and I wish Alisher was TAing for 220C as well, and I hope that he will lead our qual review sessions. Alisher was extremely prepared for discussion, especially considering this was his first time TAing this class. He came with well-organized slides that reviewed the material and he highlighted the key things for each topic. He then went through previous exam problems with us, which was also helpful. I appreciated that he went through all of the steps and explained why were going through each step in discussion and that he uploaded his detailed solutions to the problems on Canvas."
    <span style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="expand('econ220b-comments', 'By far, Alisher was the most prepared and conscientious TA I have had at UCSD. He clearly demonstrated concern for the students and I wish him the best; Great person and TA; Phenomenal TA. He went above and beyond writing out notes for discussions, soliciting feedback to improve throughout, giving detailed explanations when grading, and holding additional review sessions for each exam. He deserves all the awards. Please make him the metrics Qual TA; One thing I think would be helpful is to organize all of the information that is on the discussion slides into a typed PDF document format as well because it would be much easier to read in that form when we are reviewing the discussion slides. I think the slides are great, but it would be helpful to have it in this format in addition to the slides. His exam review sessions were extremely helpful. Alisher was very accessible. He offered two hours of office hours each week. My only suggestion is that instead of having two consecutive hours, it would be better to have one of those hours on another day or add an additional day of office hours. Alisher set up a Discord channel for us to ask our questions that came up throughout the week, and he regularly responded to questions there quickly. He was responsive via all forms of communication. He answered our questions well and clearly. Alisher solicited our feedback in the middle of the quarter and implemented our suggestions. I don\'t know how I would have gotten through metrics without Alisher as the TA.')">

    "He is one of the most well prepared TAs I've had for any of my lectures and the material covered in discussion sections are really helpful. The discussion sections were incredibly helpful and honestly helped me become more interested in the material - Alisher's thought process/approaches to the problems were really interesting and insightful throughout the quarter; I usually don't submit evaluations for TAs because I hardly interact with them, but I genuinely understood the material thoroughly because of Alisher's help. His discussions were extremely informative and he made time for those who couldn't make it to his original office hours. Would absolutely recommend him to other students."
    <span style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline;" onclick="expand('econ109-comments', 'TA Alisher Batmanov demonstrates genuine care for students, quickly responding to any messages on the class discord. He makes discussion sections engaging, both by explaining material and homework, but also by making tangible games and activities for students during discussion. He goes the extra mile to provide clear grading guidelines rather than relying solely on Gradescope\'s feedback. Overall, it has been an absolute pleasure to have a class with TA Alisher.')">

Very clear explanation of the material; Extremely helpful review sessions that helped me succeed in the class; Fantastic recorded review sessions. Great examples, and made himself constantly available for questions. Amazing TA; Straight to the point and precise. Would go through the material at a nice pace while also being open to questions.

    "Alisher was a fantastic TA for this course and helped make up for the many failures of the professor. Works graded by him were consistently done quickly and accurately; Alisher led quiz and midterm review sessions very well by being able to go through the topics and give an overview of each. By attending section I felt more prepared to take the quiz/midterm; Great teacher."
